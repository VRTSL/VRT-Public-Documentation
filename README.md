## Parser Info

The vrtsl.com site uses [MarkdownWeb](https://github.com/jgauffin/markdownweb) as its Markdown parser.

Special thanks to [Jonas Gauffin](https://github.com/jgauffin) for this nifty library!

MarkdownWeb supports these Markdown uses:
* All basic markdown formatters.
* Fenced codeblocks (with language specified as in Github pages)
* Github table format
* Links between markdown pages
* Local images

The vrtsl.com site should have propper styling support for all of the above as well, if anything is missing or looks wrong let us know!
